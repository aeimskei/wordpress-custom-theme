# WordPress Custom Theme

In this project, displays my ability to build custom theme for WordPress from scratch using best practices by referencing WordPress' documentation. Developed an understanding of PHP code. Especially since WordPress is used by more than 26.4% of the top 10 million websites as of April 		2016.  It is the most popular blogging system in use on the Web at more than 60 million websites (wikipedia), I figured it'll be good to learn.
